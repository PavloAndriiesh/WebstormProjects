<div class="section">In this case, the section element is actually after the div.

What if we wanted the section to actually appear after the floated element?</div>

<div class="after-box">Using clear we have now moved this section down below the floated div. You use the value left to clear elements floated to the left. You can also clear right and both.</div>
